A database is a collection of related data. Data is defined as known facts that can be recorded and have implicit meaning. 
Databases have the following implicit properties:
1. A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld or the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes to the miniworld are reflected in the database.
2. A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database.
3. A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.

So, a database has a data source, some degree of interaction with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively interested in its contents.

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. 

**Defining** a database involves specifying the datatypes, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database.
